# .fmbot supporter

.fmbot is non-commercial and is hosted and maintained by volunteers. In order to support us with hosting and other expenses we've added a way for people to donate and get some small perks in the bot.

We use [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/fmbot) so we can be transparent about our expenses. If you decide to sponsor us, you can see exactly where your money goes.


### Supporters get: 
- An emote behind their name (‚≠ê)
- Their name permanently added to the list of supporters (`.supporters`)
- A chance of sponsoring a chart
- Friend limit increased to 15 (up from 12)
- WhoKnows tracking increased to all their music (instead of top 4/5/6k artist/albums/tracks)
- Any future supporter advantages


### Supporter types

- Lifetime ($30 one-time purchase)
- Yearly ($14 / year)
