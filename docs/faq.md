## How do I set my username?

Please see [`.fmset`](/commands/#setting-your-lastfm-username).

## I like this bot

Cool, great to hear.

## I don't like this bot

:( Please let us know why in the [support server](https://discord.gg/5SZRGnJ).

Or make your own Last.FM bot! You can export all guild members into a handy json format using `.fmgetmembers`, so your friends don't have to re-set their usernames.

## Why does this bot exist?

This bot was made by BitL back in September 2017, and was inspired by [UB3R Bot](https://ub3r-b0t.com/). Back then the bot just had `.fm`, the charts, featuring and `.fmyoutube`. Frikandel joined in when he had the idea of `.fmfriends`, but was too lazy to make his own bot. Together they moved the bot from text files to an actual database, and the quality of the code has greatly improved since the start.

## Help! Everything is broken even though the bot is still online..

Most likely the Last.FM API is having issues, this happens every now and then. Please be patient and/or join our server for updates.
