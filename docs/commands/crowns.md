# Crowns

A crown is an award that you get if you're the #1 listener for a certain artist in a server.

To get crowns you can use [`.fmwhoknows`](/commands/artists/#fmwhoknows-fmwk-fmw).

Crown server settings are available [here](/guildsettings/crownsettings/). Leaving a server resets all your crowns.
