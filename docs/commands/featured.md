# Featured commands     

### .fmfeatured

Shows the user that is currently featured.

Anyone that is registered in fmbot can get featured! 
If you get featured, the music you listen to will be the bots avatar for an hour.
People are able to see what exactly is featured using `.fmfeatured`.

Possible featured modes:

* Recent listens
* Weekly albums
* Monthly albums
* Overall albums

If your top album doesn't have a picture, no worries. The bot will just grab the next album that has a picture.
