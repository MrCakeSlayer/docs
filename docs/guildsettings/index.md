### .fmprefix

It's possible to change the .fmbot .`fm` prefix. This isn't supported everywhere and we don't generally recommend it, but it's still an option for those who want it.

To disable the prefix, use the `prefix` command without any prefix behind it. You can also mention the bot, that will always work regardless of prefix.

!!! note "Examples"
    `.fmprefix`

    `.fmprefix !`

    `@.fmbot prefix`

    
!!! note "Examples of commands when prefix is set to !"
    `!fm`

    `!chart`

    `!whoknows`
    
    `!topalbums`
    
    `!prefix`
