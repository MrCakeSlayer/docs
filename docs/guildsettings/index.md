### Prefix update


!!! info "Default prefix has been changed as of August 20"
    After testing this out for a bit and getting (positive) feedback we've decided to support the `.` prefix by default alongside the `.fm` prefix.

    For example, you can now also use `.whoknows` instead of only `.fmwhoknows`.

    ---

    <b>Does this mean I have to change how I use .fmbot?</b>

    No! If you wish to remain prefixing all commands with `.fm` that's fine, this will always remain available by default.

    <b>Is it possible to change this back if I want?</b>

    Yes. Simply use `.prefix .fm` and it won't respond to commands with just the `.` prefix, except for the main `.fm` command of course.
    Note that this documentation site will also move to having the `.` prefix.
