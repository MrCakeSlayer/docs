# WhoKnows settings    

You can change what users appear in the whoknows commands and other commands that use all server members

These settings can only be changed by admins, users with the 'Ban Members' permission or .fmbot admins.


### .fmactivitythreshold

Allows you to filter users from commands that have not been active in a certain amount of days.

A user is counted as active once they use .fmbot.

Use the command without any parameters to disable.
