Commands are showing the wrong songs/ it's not showing what I listen to on Spotify \u00b6 We get what you're playing directly from your Last.fm profile, so please check there first to see what is showing on your profile . Last.fm often has issues with their Spotify connection. For most people it helps to reconnect Spotify in their Last.fm application settings . Last.fm also has an official guide on how to fix this. .fmbot is not affiliated with Last.fm or Spotify, so we can't fix this for you. Please don't join our support server to complain about this issue. The playcounts in the bot don't match Last.fm! \u00b6 Because we rely heavily on caching your playcounts to keep our commands fast it can sometimes happen that you don't get updated properly. In this case, try to use .fmupdate full . This completely re-builds the stored playcounts the bot has for you. This uses a lot of API calls to Last.fm, so try not to do it too often. Who picks what is featured? \u00b6 The bot randomly picks any user that has used .fmbot in the last 3 days. For more information, check out Featured How do I remove someone from WhoKnows? \u00b6 Please check the server WhoKnows settings . I have an issue with Last.fm \u00b6 We are not affiliated with Last.fm. This bot only uses their API to show you and your friends their statistics. If you have issues with Last.fm, we'd suggest you check out their support forums or their Discord server . The bot is offline \u00b6 It could be that it just happens to be updating. If it stays down, please join the support server and ping one of the developers. What is the difference between the normal bot and the develop bot? \u00b6 The develop bot is used to test new fixes and functionality before they go to the normal bot. This is usually announced in #announcements. This bot can have more downtime and bugs than the normal bot, so that is something to keep in mind. The bots currently share the same database, so switching is easy. Note that if either bot leaves your server all your server data and settings will be cleared. I like this bot \u00b6 Cool, great to hear. I don't like this bot \u00b6 :( Please let us know why in the support server . We're open to all feedback and happy to help. Or make your own Last.FM bot!

These are the questions Discord asks for bot verification, but updated with our new functionalities. Last update: 2020-11-09 What does your application do? Please be as detailed as possible, and feel free to include links to image or video examples. \u00b6 .fmbot is an open sourced bot that mostly gets used for calling the Last.fm API. Last.fm is a service that tracks what people listen to. We use their API mostly for showing what people listen to right now, showing top charts from their albums and artists over certain time periods. We also have commands that show people who listened most to certain artist, and they can add friends and see their latest songs as well. You can also search Spotify, Youtube and Genius for songs and more. The bot allows you to set your last.fm username, but it also allows you to set server-wide settings. You can see more information on our site: https://fmbot.xyz and Github: https://github.com/fmbot-discord/fmbot WHAT DISCORD DATA DO YOU STORE? \u00b6 When someone sets their last.fm username or registers in to the bot, we store the following Discord data: Discord user ID That they are in that server Their nickname or name on that server When someone sets their server settings: Server name Server ID Members in the server that have been registered in .fmbot When someone uses a command, the debug log stores this: Discord name or nickname of the user executing the command Discord user id Server name Server id The text in the command We don't store any data from users that have not registered in the bot. FOR WHAT PURPOSE(S) DO YOU STORE IT? \u00b6 To identify who is calling the command and get the appropriate parameters to customize their command. We only store the users from a server that have registered in our bot. This is for commands that allow server wide statistics. Logs are used for debugging and helping people with bug reports. FOR HOW LONG DO YOU STORE IT? \u00b6 Settings data: Forever, or until deleted. Logs: Cleared every month. WHAT IS THE PROCESS FOR USERS TO REQUEST DELETION OF THEIR DATA? \u00b6 For user data we have a command (.fmremove). For server data people can remove the bot and all the data will be deleted. Logs get cleared every month. WHAT SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE DO YOU USE? \u00b6 .fmbot is currently hosted on a private server at my home. HOW HAVE YOU SECURED ACCESS TO YOUR SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE? \u00b6 We have a remote desktop account that is secured with 2FA, this is used for remote connections. After logging in, you also need to enter the server password. For accessing the database, you need to enter another password. HOW CAN USERS CONTACT YOU WITH SECURITY ISSUES? \u00b6 Through our server and DMs, or through Github issues. We are visibly identified as developers on the server. DOES YOUR APPLICATION UTILIZE OTHER THIRD-PARTY AUTH SERVICES OR CONNECTIONS? IF SO, WHICH, AND WHY? \u00b6 We have multiple connections. For Last.fm we allow people to connect their account to the bot, after which we store their last.fm session token. We are connected to the following services: Last.fm Spotify Youtube Genius These connections are to show users their song history and search these services for quick links to songs and lyrics. Extra info \u00b6 Personal .fmbot data will never be shared with any 3rd party services unless explicitly specified.

See related FAQ entry . Things to note: \u00b6 Commands that use your plays will also update you automatically or just get their information directly from last.fm. Manually updating only makes sense if you don't appear properly in whoknows. Updating already gets done automatically every 48 hours, so using this command isn't required to stay up to date. If you edit your scrobble history this command might not work properly, so you can use .fmupdate full . Please don't do a full update too often, if the normal update doesn't work good enough for you please let us know. Commands that use locally stored plays (like .fmoverview and .fmstreak ) will also update you automatically. Commands like .fm and .fmartist get their info directly from Last.fm.
